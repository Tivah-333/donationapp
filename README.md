    * Follow the official installation guide: [Flutter Install Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
    * After installation, run flutter doctor in your terminal to verify your setup.

* *Google Account:* Required to create and manage a Firebase project.
* *Firebase CLI (Optional, but recommended for advanced features):*

## üèÉ‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è Running the Application

1.  *Clone the Repository:*
    Run these commands in you terminal:
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory_name>


2.  *Install Flutter Dependencies:*
    * In the root of your Flutter project (where pubspec.yaml is located):
      Run;
      flutter pub get


3.  *Verify Firebase Configuration Files:*
    * This project expects the following Firebase configuration files to be present:
        * For Android: android/app/google-services.json
        * For iOS: ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
        * For all platforms: lib/firebase_options.dart (generated by flutterfire configure)
    * If these files are missing after cloning, you will need to obtain them from your Firebase project's console and place them in the correct directories. You might also need to run flutterfire configure if firebase_options.dart is missing or outdated.


    
4.  *Prepare a Device/Emulator:*
    * *Android Emulator/Physical Android Device*
    * *iOS Simulator/Physical iOS Device (macOS only)*
    * *Web Browser*
    * *Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)*

    To list available devices, run:
    flutter devices


5.  *Run the Flutter Application:*
    * With your chosen device/emulator ready, execute the following command in the project's root directory:
      Run;
      flutter run

        * To run on a *specific device* (use its ID from flutter devices):
          flutter run -d <device_id>

        * To run on a *web browser*:
          flutter run -d chrome # or another browser like edge, firefox

        * To run as a *desktop app*:
          flutter run -d windows # or macos, linux


    The application will build and launch on your selected target, connecting to the Firebase project configured in google-services.json, GoogleService-Info.plist, and firebase_options.dart.
